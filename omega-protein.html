		<h4>Omega Protein is------ </h4>

			<h3>Tell the story of sustainability through illustration</h3>

			<p>Omega Protein has been around for 100 years and has delivered quality ingredients that improve the nutritional integrity of food, supplements and animal feed to allow consumers and their families to live healthier lives with better nutrition. Leading the illustration and design for the storytelling pieced, I aided in explaining their sustainability initiatives and elevated their brand to have more of a human touch. We wanted the users to read the paragraphs of text, so we created this like an illustrated story book, connecting each panel seamlessly - encouraging the reader to continue on and down the piece.</p>

			<blockquote class="pullquote-left">Compelling visuals to accompany a story about sustainability and the environment</blockquote>

			<h3>Geometric shapes enhance the map</h3>
			<p>The client wanted to uniquely illustration who they were by showing where they are located and where their fisheries are. Using subtle geometric shapes and natural blues and greens to uniquely enhance the topography of the United States. Headquarters and specific cities are highlighted and encourages the user to explore.</p>
