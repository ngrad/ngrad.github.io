			<h1>About</h1>

			<img src="img/Nikole-Head-Shot.png">

			<p>I am an interactive designer creating inspiring, emotional engagement on the web and beyond. Focusing on user experience fundamentals blended with illustration, usability philosophies, and powerful color, I am passionate in making sure everything is cohesive and memerable.</p>

			<p>I received a BFA in Graphic Design at Salisbury University in Maryland, where I worked with Redhead Companies and Merkle and received the faculty's President's Award for "San Francisco". I thrive off working with clients who are as passionate about their product as I am about design. With this perfect combination, true innovation and creative work can be developed. </p>
			 
			<p>Color Ninja of the DC Jewish Community Center, I single-handedly took the center through a rebrand to a more vibrant and streamlined image in the community. To follow, I accepted the Design Director role at <a href="http://nav.co/">NAV</a>, a design studio in Washington, DC, where I focused on user centered design, creating interfaces and designing seamless user exeperiences for desktop and mobile. I then served on the design team at the <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/">Sunlight Foundation</a>. Our team at the time adopted innovative design research practices, <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2015/08/04/learning-to-design-in-the-open/">designing in the open</a>, <a href="https://dribbble.com/nikgrad">illustrating</a> to enhance the user experience and implementing front end development. <a href="http://designresearch.is/">Read more about design research.</a> I currently am the Senior Web Designer at an energey efficiency enterprise software company called Opower. In just 7 short months, I lead the redesign and rebrand of our corporate website, redesigned the email template and landing page systems and have created a library of custom illustrations for the company to utilize.</p>

			<p>Along with design, I love getting my knees scratched up playing ultimate frisbee, walking my family dog, Country, the Washington Nationals and bike cruising DC with my <a href="https://twitter.com/KylePool93">bearded friend</a>. I find inspiration from the vibrancy of Washington, DC, and the one the only Georgia O'Keefe.</p>


			<blockquote class="pullquote-left">"So I said to myself, 'I have things in my head that are not like what anyone has taught me - shapes and ideas so near to me - so natural to my way of being and thinking that it hasn't occurred to me to put them down.' I decided to start anew - to strip away what I had been taught - to accept as true my own thinking. I was alone and singularly free, working into my own, unknown - no one to satisfy but myself."<p>-Georgia O'Keefe</p></blockquote>
