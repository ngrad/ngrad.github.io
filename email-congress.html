	<h1>Email Congress</h1>
	<h2>Last summer, Sunlight created a feature that allowed you to email your lawmakers just as easily as you would a friend or colleague. One year later, we are improved the user experience by writing new text and illustrating custom icons to enhance the meaning of it.</h2>

	<h4>Email Congress is------ </h4>

	<h3>An improved user experience</h3>

	<p>The impetus to these changes started with user support tickets â€” a lot of them. Users were confused and quickly frustrated with certain parts of the emailing process, including an introductory email Sunlight had to send to users in order for them to utilize the tool.</p>


	<h3>Emailing Congress shouldn't be hard is the thing I made</h3>
	<p>UX design and content strategy focusing on properly describing how the user capitlizes on this tool
	Email design, responsive layout
	Custom Illustrations to help the explainer email
	Custom illustration to show how the Sunlight Foundation through Contact Congress has made it as easy as email to contact your local legislator.</p>
