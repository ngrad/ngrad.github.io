		<h4>A strong lead in paragraph. </h4>

		<h3>An improved user experience</h3>

		<p>The impetus to these changes started with user support tickets â€” a lot of them. Users were confused and quickly frustrated with certain parts of the emailing process, including an introductory email Sunlight had to send to users in order for them to utilize the tool.</p>


		<h3>Emailing Congress shouldn't be hard is the thing I made</h3>
		<p>UX design and content strategy focusing on properly describing how the user capitlizes on this tool
		Email design, responsive layout
		Custom Illustrations to help the explainer email
		Custom illustration to show how the Sunlight Foundation through Contact Congress has made it as easy as email to contact your local legislator.</p>
