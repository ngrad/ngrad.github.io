	<h4>Global Financial Integrity is a Washington DC non-profit research and advisory organization producing reports on illicit financial flows, the illegal movements of money from one country to another. </h4>

	<p>It lacks images, but at least it has style. And it has links, even if they don't goanywhere</p>

	<p>GFI fights everyday for transparency and needed two things from us:  to elevate their website brand and to succinctly describe their mission, making it unwaveringly clear what their mission was. When they came to us for website redesign we rolled up our sleeves up to conduct a nitty gritty card sorting exercise to ensure thoughtful information architecture to wireframes to a polished visual design. 

GFI's goal was to accurately communicate their mission as they had problems with folks in their space neglecting to know who they were. We placed their mission at the optimal reading location on the homepage and used strong imagery of boats, which is typically how money leaves said countries. <a href="#">By expanding their color palette beyond the blues in their logo, their website has clear hierarchy and a fresh new look.</a></p>
